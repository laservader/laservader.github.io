            <p>
              The Charities listed have been researched by our team, but I encourage you to look at their websites and decide for yourself which cause you would like to support.
              <br>

              <h3>Backround</h3>
              A little bit of backround, my friends and I wanted to get into building websites, We taught ourselves and decided a great project would be a website involving charity. We are fans of bitcoin, and so this website was born. We designed and built the games, and while they are simple, we hope you can enjoy them!
              We are new to this, so we would love for you to contact us if there are any issues. We are not partned with any of these charities.

              <h3>Contact</h3>
